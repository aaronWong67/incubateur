jaxrsdoclet
===============

A *DRAFT* JaxRsDoclet, 'cause I hate the output of Swagger!

## Todo

### Must have

  * try to use bootstrap and create a template looking good
  * add another resource and take a look at what happens
  * we need a left nav bar with links to overview and to all resources
  * parse methods annotated with GET, POST, etc...
  
### Nice to have

  * dest dirs and template should be parameterized
  * fix dependency mess (junit, jmock, etc...)
  * use last plugin versions
  * setup title
  * setup a logo?
