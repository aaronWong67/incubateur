zipdrop
=======

__**PAY ATTENTION**: this is a work in progress__

**zipdrop** is a package management tool using `zip` files.   
`zip` file has to contains a specific directory called `install` where
**zipdrop** will find installation scripts.   
**zipdrop** is useful when you need to install applications on companies host
where the `root` user is not available and where you don't need a huge
dependency management (like done by `apt-get` or `yum`/`rpm`).

## Tutorial
