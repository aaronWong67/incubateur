databaseadapter-maven-plugin
============================

Represents a generator of Java source code needed to work with a database.

Motivation
----------------

Some tasks are so repetitive and absolutely the most boring to do.

Development of code (or others) related to database table and columns is one of them.

The aim of this maven plugin is to provide a way to write those things using a template engine and generate it fast for all tables/columns to be used.
